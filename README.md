# Graduation Projects Notebook App 




### I'm now in the holiday, before the final year , and we are supposed to <br/> fora graduation project, so I thought about making a notebook app, <br/> where you can write your notes and save them in a database, and you can also <br/>

### It is simple idea build using this tech stack:

- **Frontend**: React.js + Vite + TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express + TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Styling**: MUI + tailwind CSS
- **DevOps**: Docker + GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## How to use the app:

#### just one command to run the app locally:

```bash
docker-compose up
```
#### and for stop the app:
```bash
docker-compose down
```


### The app will be deployed on:
- **Frontend**: Vercel
- **Backend**: Render
